# Image Carousel

## component

This is my first attempt at creating a modular / reusable image carousel with multiple styles.

Through webpack's dynamic importing capabilities, images are lazy-loaded on demand.

### HOW TO:

Add a <carousel-component><carousel-component> to your html.

### TO DO:

- shift buttons to left and right of inner edge of image
  - lower opacity

* figure out what to do about resizing (keep original image ratio)
  - maybe add blank space (letterbox)
* AwesomeFont or NerdFont icon for arrows
  - only import what's necessary!!!
* add circle indicators at bottom

#### Maybe?

- make a mode with next/previous image previews
- different styles of arrows
- optional gallery at bottom with thumbnails
